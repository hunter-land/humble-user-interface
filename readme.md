HUI was created to provide a simple and customizable set of GUI elements
to a C++ SDL environment with minimal constraints and overhead. With HUI,
you define an element with a texture, dstrect, and an optional angle and
flip.
<!--Humble User Interface is a GUI library built on SDL2 v2.0.12.-->

## Features

  - Buttons
  - Drag & drop items
  - Drag & drop holders
  - Scroll bars
  - Scrollable element sets
  - Text fields
- The above allow for the creation of all other elements:

  - Search Field (Text field + opt. Scroll bar + opt. Set)
